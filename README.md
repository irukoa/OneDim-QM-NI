# OneDim-QM-NI
### One Dimensional Quantum Mechanics - Numerical Implementation.

This is a tiny modern Fortran library for illustration and teaching purposes. Its aim is to help people study Fortran together with one dimensional quantum systems.

## Working principle

### Steady state systems.

The library solves the time independent Schr√∂dinger equation in the position basis,

$$
H\Psi(x)=\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2 \Psi(x)}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\Psi(x) = E_n \Psi(x).
$$

The Laplace operator is considered by its finite difference approximation,

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \Psi(x)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\Psi(x+\epsilon) -2\Psi(x) + \Psi(x-\epsilon)}{\epsilon^2}.
$$

This leads to a straightforward matrix representation of the Hamiltonian operator in the position basis. By employing the discretization

$$
x \to x_i = x_s + x_f - x_s \frac{i-1}{N-1},\;\epsilon = \frac{x_f - x_s}{N-1}
$$

we obtain

$$
[H\Psi(x)]_i = \alpha \Psi(x_{i-1}) + [-2\alpha + V(x_i)]\Psi(x_i) + \alpha \Psi(x_{i+1}) = E_n\Psi(x_i)
$$

with

$$
\alpha = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m\epsilon^2}.
$$

This is a linear system expressible as a matrix equation. Diagonalizing, we obtain the eigenvalues and eigenstates to pass from the position basis to the Hamiltonian basis.

### Time dependent systems.

The library performs dynamical simulations by considering the Suzuki-Trotter expansion of the time evolution operator,

$$
\hat{U}(t_k, t_{\text{st}}) = \prod_{j=1}^{k}\text{exp}\left[-\frac{i}{\hbar} \delta t \hat{H}(t_j) \right]+ \mathcal{O}(\delta t^2),
$$

for a number of discretization points $N_t$ and an instant $t_k$, $k\in[1, N_t]$,

$$
t_j = t_{\text{st}} + T\frac{j-1}{N_t-1} = t_{\text{st}} + \delta t (j-1).
$$

In this case, $\hat{H}(t)$ is the time dependent Hamiltonian. We consider that it can be expressed in terms of the steady state Hamiltonian operator and the position operator. In practice, $\hat{H}(t)$ is constructed in the Hamiltonian basis.

### Boundary conditions

The possible boundary conditions are,

#### Dirichlet

$$
\Psi(x_{1}) = 0,
$$

$$
\Psi(x_{N}) = 0.
$$

Applicable independently to each end.

#### Neumann

$$
\Psi'(x_{1}) = 0,
$$

$$
\Psi'(x_{N}) = 0.
$$

Applicable independently to each end.

#### Robin

$$
\Psi(x_{1}) = \alpha \Psi'(x_{1}),
$$

$$
\Psi(x_{N}) = -\alpha \Psi'(x_{N}).
$$

Applicable independently to each end.

#### Periodic

$$
\Psi(x_{1}) = \Psi(x_{N}),
$$

$$
\Psi'(x_{1}) = \Psi'(x_{N}).
$$

#### Free

Assumes singular Sturm-Liouville problem.

Any of the boundary conditions are imposed by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem

$$
A\psi_n = E_n B\psi_n
$$

with

$$
[A]_{2:N-1,2:N-1} = [H]_{2:N-1,2:N-1}
$$

and

$$
[B]_{2:N-1,2:N-1} = I_{N-2},\;B_{1, 1} = B_{N, N} = 0.
$$

Thus, given that

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N}A_{1i}\psi_n(x_i) = 0,
$$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N}A_{Ni}\psi_n(x_i) = 0,
$$

we fix boundary conditions by setting the constants $A_{1i}$, $A_{Ni}$.

# API

The following derived types are defined in the module `OneDim_QM_NI`:
``` fortran
type, public :: steady_state_system
type, extends(steady_state_system), public :: time_dependent_system
```

The library works with double precision numbers.
``` fortran
integer, parameter, public :: dp = kind(1.0d0)
```
